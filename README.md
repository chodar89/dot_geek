## Deployment
- App is running and hosted on [Heroku](https://dot-geek.herokuapp.com)
### Steps to deploy
#### Static files
- Static files are in dot-geek app folder:<br> <strong>`dot-geek/static`</strong>
#### Database pre set values
- only Size Chart requires pre set data
- insert sizes in brackets (CAPITAL LETTERS!) to Size Chart table: ('XS', 'S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL', 'XXXL')
#### Steps to deploy app on Heroku
- create an account on [heroku](https://heroku.com)
- after sign up, login and create a new app with unique name:<br>
  New > Create new app<br>
  or create app from CLI - [manual](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps)
- go to Resources tab and get <strong>Heroku Postgres</strong> add-on
- you need to create requirements.txt file and the Procfile<br>
  From command line:
  ```
  $ pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
  $ echo "web: gunicorn your_app_name.wsgi:application" > Procfile
  ```
- push te code to <strong>GitHub</strong> and from <strong>Deploy Card</strong> in Heroku deploy your branch
- Set up config vars. Go to <strong>Heroku > Settings</strong> tab and cicl <strong>Reveal Config Vars</strong><br>
1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (only if you use AWS S3 Bucket)
2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (only if you use AWS S3 Bucket)
3. DATABASE_URL
4. DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
5. STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (only if you use stripe payment)
6. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (only if you use stripe payment)
### Run app local
#### Before start
- if you would like to run app with the same settings, than you will need to read how to set up [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com) buckets
- you can check Stripe Django tutorial [here](https://testdriven.io/blog/django-stripe-tutorial/)
- and AWS S3 tutorial [here](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2017/08/01/how-to-setup-amazon-s3-in-a-django-project.html)
#### How to run app on your local machine
- install or update Python to version 3.x
- create [virtual env](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- download all files to local dir
- now install all packs from requirements.txt
  ```
  $ pip install -r requiremenst.txt
  ```
- you will need to create <code>.env</code> file next and set up your own config vars
1. SECRET_KEY
2. USER
3. PASSWORD
4. HOST
5. STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
6. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- in <strong>`settings.py`</strong> we have statement that checks if we are in dev mode, see belowe<br>
  if you would like to use local DB than just remove/comment or do not add 'DATABASE_URL' to your env file.
    ```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        # Local DB
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': os.getenv('ENGINE'),
                'NAME': 'dot_geek',
                'USER': os.getenv('USER'),
                'PASSWORD': os.getenv('PASSWORD'),
                'HOST': os.getenv('HOST'),
                'TEST': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                }
            }
        }
    ```
- and comment out other DATABASES setting at line 105 in <strong>`settings.py`</strong>
- in the same time you should install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin on your computer [link](https://www.postgresql.org)
- once you set this up run 
  ```
  $ python manage.py createsuperuser
  ``` 
- follow the command line and provide data
- than you will need to do migrations to your DB run in terminal:
  ```
  $ python manage.py makemigrations
  ``` 
  and 
  ```
  $ python manage.py migrate
  ```
- if you dont want to use S3 bucket instead you would like to hold everything in local dirs, you need to comment out all AWS settings lines in <bold>settings.py</bold> plus <code>STATICFILES_LOCATION, STATICFILES_STORAGE, MEDIAFILES_LOCATION, DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE</code>
- to collect all static files run in terminal:
  ```
  $ python manage.py collectstatic
  ```
- finally run the app:
  ```
  $ python manage.py runserver
  ```
